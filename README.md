# BitBetter

This project is a tool to modify bitwardens core dll to allow me to self license.
Beware this does janky IL magic to rewrite the bitwarden core dll and install my self signed certificate.

## But why? Its open source?

Yes, bitwarden is great. If I didn't care about it i wouldn't be doing this.
I was bothered that if i want to host bitwarden myself, at my house, 
for my family to use (with the ability to share access) I would still have to pay a monthly ENTERPRISE organization fee.
To host it myself. And maintain it myself. Basically WTH was bit wardening doing I was paying them for?

## You should have reached out to bitwarden

Thanks, good idea. And I did. Currently they're not focused on solving this issue - yet. 
To be clear i'm totally happy to give them my money. Offer a perpetual family license, and i'd pay for it. 
Offer me a license thats tied to a version, I'll gladly rebuy another when a new version comes out AND i'm ready to upgrade.

I provided all these suggestions to bitwarden and they told me to wait until next year. Until then there's this.
